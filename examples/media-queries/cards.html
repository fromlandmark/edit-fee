        <p>Tension. Movement. Harmony. And a moment in time. These elements are written into the lines of a circular
            sculpture, a twist of bronze, oak and light-reflecting gold that appears to hover in the air. A new creation
            by Irish artist Joseph Walsh, Magnus Rinn is designed to coexist with the sky, wind and natural light – and
            in Japan, it’s on track to become an enduring symbol of his homeland’s contemporary creative heritage.</p>

        <p>
            Six metres tall and seven years in the making, the sculpture is positioned just outside the entrance to the
            Irish pavilion at Osaka Expo 2025 (which runs 13 April – 13 October). A dialogue between material and form,
            the pavilion and its signature sculpture are one of a series of new creative projects masterminded by the
            Irish government that aim to deepen cultural ties between Ireland and Japan.</p>

        <h3>Delve into the Irish Pavilion at 2025 Expo Osaka</h3>
        <p>Another landmark project is Ireland House, a 3,000 sq m flagship government facility wrapped in Irish
            limestone and oak latticework. Overlooking a park in central Tokyo, it will open just days after the Osaka
            Expo. Designed by Irish practice Henry J Lyons, the complex will be home to the Irish Embassy and the
            ambassador’s official residence, as well as a library and exhibition and performance area.</p>

        <p>The opening of Ireland House in Tokyo will be marked by an inaugural exhibition celebrating Japanese and
            Irish creativity. Entitled ‘Rinn/’, it is curated by Walsh, and his not-for-profit cultural programme Making
            In, as well as by Wahei Aoyama, founder of respected Tokyo gallery A Lighthouse called Kanata. For Walsh,
            these projects reflect an ongoing creative dialogue between the two nations. He says, ‘I feel we connect in
            a respect for the unknown, for our ancestors, for the mystery and mythology that forms both of our
            cultures.’</p>
